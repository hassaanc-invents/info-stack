            <p>These days, education is no longer limited by books just because of the internet. An increasing number of students looking for answers to their questions of different subjects from different areas of Pakistan. Just because of their non-IT background and lack of data mining capability they can't find the exact answers to their questions from different platforms over the internet. There is a strong need of creating a platform that helps them to extract answers from one platform.</p><br>
            <p>So we are here to focuses on how to upload a question on the website and how to answer that questions for the students. 
I have decided to develop a web-based project because a website is easily accessible by everyone from anywhere.

            <p>In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them.Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming.</p>
